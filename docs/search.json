    "text": "Founded in 2023, the Santa Barbara Statistics Initiative (SBSI) aims to foster a greater involvement between Santa Barbara-area students (both undergraduate and graduate) and the fields of Statistics and Data Science.\nCognizant of the myriad of on-campus student organizations, the founders of SBSI opted to not simply overwrite the hard work of these organizations; rather, SBSI was designed as a sort of “umbrella” or “envelope” to encompass these already-existing organizations.\nThe main goals of SBSI are:\n\nto provide support (financially, physically, and emotionally) to already-existing Statistics-related student organizations\nto facilitate and host a variety of events throughout the academic year\nto encourage greater interaction with Statistics and Data Science by all Santa Barbara-area students"
